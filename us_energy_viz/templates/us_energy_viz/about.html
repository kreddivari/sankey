                                            <p>At a time when many people propose transforming the world’s energy
                                                system, it is instructive to consider past energy transitions. The
                                                history of past U.S. energy transitions can help us understand our
                                                potential future pathways.</p>
                                            <p>The U.S. Energy History Visualization project is conducted by members of
                                                the University of Chicago’s Center for Robust Decision-making on Climate
                                                and Energy Policy (RDCEP), under the direction of Assoc. Professor Liz

                                            <p>The energy history tool consists of an interactive Sankey diagram of U.S.
                                                per capita primary energy use from 1800&ndash;2017: a mapping of primary
                                                energy sources to sectoral uses. Data on sectoral energy use before 1990
                                                was compiled from historical sources including the U.S. Census and the
                                                Census Bureau’s Historical Statistics of the United States. Data for
                                                individual years after 1990 is provided by the <a

                                            <p>To use the graph, play an animation with the <span style="font-family:sans-serif;font-weight: bold;">&#8220;</span>play<span style="font-family:sans-serif;font-weight: bold;">&#8221;</span> button at bottom
                                                left, or drag the timeline slider to control the animation by hand.
                                                Black circles along the timeline mark years of especial interest; click
                                                these to open up additional information. To more fairly show the energy
                                                requirements of the different sectors, the default setting for the
                                                animation is to allocate the waste heat from energy generation to those
                                                sectors that use electricity. Click the switch at bottom left to turn
                                                off this feature. The agricultural sector here represents on-field
                                                energy use and does not include embodied energy in fertilizer.</p>
                                            <p>The Sankey uses units of per capita energy use to best show the structure
                                                of the energy sector. Per capita energy use rose by ×3 from 1800-2017,
                                                but note that the U.S. population also grew by ×60 over this time
                                                period. The stacked bar chart at bottom shows the evolution of fuel
                                                usage, i.e. the fractional contribution of each fuel to the U.S. energy
                                                mix. The U.S. was primarily wood-powered through the late 1890s,
                                                primarily coal-powered through the 1930s, and now is powered largely by
                                                petroleum (oil) and natural gas.</p>
